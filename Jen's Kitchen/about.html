        <p>People who know me know that I love to cook. I've created this site to share some of my favorite recipes and online food resources. <i>Bon Appetit!</i></p>
        <p>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.</p>
        <p>If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at jen@example.com.</p>
